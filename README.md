# UFC-fight-winner-Prediction-System
Hey guys! This is a UFC fight winner prediction system using a basic classification ML model and deployed using streamlit

I took the dataset of UFC fighters and fight data from (1993 - 2021) :
[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata)

I've just used a basic Logistic Regression model to make this Project.
I'm currently trying to scrape the Data from [The Official UFC website](https://ufc.com)
Check out the working web app:  ðŸ‘‡
